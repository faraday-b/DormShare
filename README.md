# DormShare 

Project Idea: DormShare is a community-based web application designed for students living in shared or temporary accommodation. The platform allows users to lend and rent everyday items (such as kitchen appliances, tools, or study equipment) instead of purchasing them. Users earn points for successfully lending and returning items, which can then be used to rent items from other members. DormShare promotes sustainability, reduces unnecessary spending, and encourages collaboration within student communities.
